# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

Solutions to the University Lab Manual: **50 exercises across Labs 1-10**, including all Basic, Intermediate and Challenge tasks, plus **Lab 11's design pattern demonstrations and Library Management System mini-project**.

Each exercise is in its matching numbered folder. Java filenames describe the task, public class names match their filenames, and source comments retain the original lab and exercise numbers.

## Start here

- [Exercise index](#exercise-index): find the correct program for each task.
- [Running the exercises](#running-the-exercises): compile, run and supply input.
- [Library mini-project](#lab-11-library-management-system): run the menu application.
- [Lab report](report/LAB_REPORT.html): objectives, source code, recorded output and conclusions.
- [Lab record](report/LAB_RECORD.md): lab summaries and verification evidence.
- [Viva preparation](report/VIVA.md): answers to the manual's oral questions.

## Requirements

- JDK **17 or later**, with both `java` and `javac` available on `PATH`.
- A terminal and any Java editor or IDE. The commands below use Windows PowerShell.
- No external Java libraries, Maven or Gradle are required.

Check the installed tools:

```powershell
java -version
javac -version
```

## Folder structure

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| [1](1/) | Classes and objects |
| [2](2/) | Constructors, `this` and static members |
| [3](3/) | Encapsulation and access modifiers |
| [4](4/) | Inheritance |
| [5](5/) | Polymorphism |
| [6](6/) | Abstraction, abstract classes and interfaces |
| [7](7/) | Exception handling |
| [8](8/) | Generics and collections |
| [9](9/) | Nested types, enums, records and the Object contract |
| [10](10/) | File I/O, lambdas and streams |
| [11](11/) | Design pattern demonstrations and the library mini-project |
| [report](report/) | Lab report, lab record, viva notes and execution evidence |
| [verification](verification/) | Repeatable verification script and Java check programs |

The verification script creates `.build/` for compiled classes and temporary test data. This directory is excluded from the submission archive.

## Running the exercises

### Compile and run one exercise

Starting from the workspace root, run Lab 1 Exercise 1:

```powershell
cd 1
javac --release 17 -encoding UTF-8 CarBasics.java
java CarBasics
```

Use the filename with `.java` when compiling and the public class name without the extension when running. Substitute the program from the exercise index for another task. Each Lab 1-10 program contains its own helper types and runs independently.

You can also run an individual source file directly from the workspace root:

```powershell
java .\2\TemperatureFactories.java
```

### Compile all exercises in one folder

From inside the numbered folder:

```powershell
$sources = (Get-ChildItem -Filter *.java).FullName
javac --release 17 -encoding UTF-8 $sources
```

Then run the desired class, for example `java PersonAddress` in Lab 1. Compiling creates `.class` files; the `.java` files are the source files for submission.

### Input and file exercises

| Program | Input and behaviour |
|---|---|
| [SafeDivision](7/SafeDivision.java) | Enter two integers, such as `8 2`. Try `8 0` for division by zero and `hello 2` for invalid input. |
| [WordFrequency](8/WordFrequency.java) | Enter a paragraph on one line. Words are counted without case sensitivity and ranked by frequency. |
| [FileLines](10/FileLines.java) | Enter five lines. They are saved and read back; fewer than five lines do not create a partial file. |
| [FileStatistics](10/FileStatistics.java) | Reads [sample.txt](10/sample.txt) by default when run from Lab 10, or accepts a file path as its first argument. |
| [LearnerReports](10/LearnerReports.java) | Reads [learners.csv](10/learners.csv) by default when run from Lab 10, or accepts a CSV path and an optional report directory. |

For the following examples, start in Lab 10 and compile that folder first:

```powershell
java FileLines saved-lines.txt
java FileStatistics sample.txt
java LearnerReports learners.csv grade-reports
```

The last command writes `report-A.txt`, `report-B.txt` and `report-C.txt` into `grade-reports`. The learner CSV uses the header `name,roll,gpa`. Relative file paths are resolved from the terminal's current directory.

## Lab 11: Library Management System

The [mini-project](11/) combines validated classes, inheritance, abstraction, Borrowable, custom exceptions, ID-keyed maps, streams and CSV persistence.

Starting from the workspace root:

```powershell
cd 11
$sources = (Get-ChildItem -Filter *.java).FullName
javac --release 17 -encoding UTF-8 $sources
java LibraryApp
```

The menu supports adding books/DVDs, registering members, borrowing, returning, listing overdue loans, searching by title and listing items. Choose `0` to save and exit. Completed operations are also saved when input ends.

By default, the application loads and saves `items.csv`, `members.csv` and `loans.csv` in `data/` relative to the current directory. To select a separate data directory:

```powershell
java LibraryApp my-library-data
```

Members may hold at most three active loans. Books loan for 14 days and DVDs for 7 days. Invalid saved data is reported at startup and is not replaced with an empty library.

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [PROJECT_REPORT.md](11/PROJECT_REPORT.md) | Requirements mapping, design choices, persistence and limitations |
| [CLASS_DIAGRAM.md](11/CLASS_DIAGRAM.md) | Class relationships in Mermaid format |
| [LibraryTests.java](11/LibraryTests.java) | Repeatable mini-project checks |
| [SingletonFactoryDemo.java](11/SingletonFactoryDemo.java) | Singleton configuration and email/SMS factory demonstration |
| [StrategyObserverDemo.java](11/StrategyObserverDemo.java) | Runtime discount strategy and grade-listener demonstration |

After compiling Lab 11, run the pattern examples with `java SingletonFactoryDemo` and `java StrategyObserverDemo`.

## Verification

From the workspace root, run the [verification script](verification/Verify.ps1):

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\verification\Verify.ps1
```

The script compiles with Java 17 compatibility and compiler warnings enabled, runs every exercise and both pattern demonstrations, checks error paths and file outputs, and verifies library persistence across three separate menu sessions. It writes execution transcripts and rendered console-output images under [report/evidence](report/evidence/) and regenerates the HTML lab report. Test data is kept separately in `.build/`.

To generate text-only report evidence:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\verification\Verify.ps1 -SkipImages
```

The last recorded verification on **14 October 2026** passed:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Lab 1-10 exercises | 50 executed successfully |
| Design pattern demonstrations | 2 executed successfully |
| Total recorded executions, including additional checks | 62 passed |
| Exercise boundary and invariant checks | 37 passed |
| Library checks | 26 passed |
| Library menu persistence | Create/save, reload/return and reload again passed |

See the [verification summary](report/evidence/verification-summary.json), [exercise checks](report/evidence/ExerciseBoundaryChecks.txt) and [library checks](report/evidence/LibraryChecks.txt) for the recorded results. Output images are rendered from actual execution transcripts; they are not desktop screenshots.

## Assumptions

Where the manual does not specify values, the programs use these documented choices:

| Area | Choice |
|---|---|
| Lab 3 marks | A: 75-100; B: 60-74; C: 50-59; F: 0-49 |
| Lab 10 GPA bands | A: 3.5-4.0; B: 3.0 to below 3.5; C: below 3.0, within the valid 0-4 range |
| Circle counter | Counts successful constructions, not currently live objects after garbage collection |
| File statistics | Words are separated by whitespace; characters are Unicode code points, including line endings |
| Library loan periods | Books: 14 days; DVDs: 7 days |
| Overdue rule | A due date before today is overdue; an item due today is not |
| Library storage | Active loans are persisted; returned loans are removed from the active list |

The library assumes one running instance. Its CSV files are replaced individually; the three-file save is not a single database transaction. Further details are in the [project report](11/PROJECT_REPORT.md).

## Reports and submission

- [LAB_REPORT.html](report/LAB_REPORT.html): open in a web browser to read all exercise objectives, source, outputs and conclusions.
- [LAB_RECORD.md](report/LAB_RECORD.md): lab summaries, prediction exercises and verification links.
- [VIVA.md](report/VIVA.md): preparation for the manual's oral questions.
- [Java_OOP_Assignment.zip](Java_OOP_Assignment.zip): packaged source, reports and verification tools.

The archive is a snapshot. If you modify files after it was created, recreate it from the workspace root before submission:

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,report,verification,README.md -DestinationPath Java_OOP_Assignment.zip -Force
```
